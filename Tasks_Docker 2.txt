Problem 1: Deploy a MySQL database called app-database. Use the mysql latest image, 
and use the -e flag to set MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to P4sSw0rd0!. The container should run in the background.

Problem 2: Deploy an Nginx container using Docker and access the Nginx welcome page via both the container IP and the host machine's IP.

Problem 3: Deploy the Nginx container using Docker with --network host and access it directly from the host. Then compare it with the standard deployment from Problem 2.

Problem 4: Create a custom Docker bridge network with a specific subnet. Deploy two containers on that network and verify they can communicate with each other using container names or IPs.

Problem 5: We will try to ping the Problem 2 container (nginx running on default bridge) from one of the containers on the custom network, and observe what happens.
Then we will attach that container to the custom network and test connectivity again.
